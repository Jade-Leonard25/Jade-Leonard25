## Hi there 👋
   #### Im Jade Leonard ,frontend developer from Philippines.

I build some component library, design web interface and create real time applications.
yeah 3am is the best time of me, its building time then :).


My main Tech stack is SvelteKit,Nextjs,ReactJs,Typescript,Javascript, Framer-motion for some animation but usually is used my own component library

My projects are my experience for coding. It helps so much for developing learning tools, also the services that offer deployment with 0 cost will make you 100% understand building realtime application.
Some of my projects are CI/CD pipeline ready :).


Notes : Your never burn out your not the real one have a nice day everybody, dont let AI replace your gift as person. Dont stop learning thank you.
